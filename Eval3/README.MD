## Question
Write an ALP that will examine a set of strings. 
The length of each string is four characters. 
The number of strings to be examined is stored in location 'cnt'. The strings are stored starting from location 'dat1'. 
The ALP should scan each string and see if it is equal to '    ' (four blank spaces). 
If yes, all strings that follow this string of four blank spaces should be reversed until the next string of four blank spaces is encountered.
